In this blog post, I'm going to go over the history of this project briefly from the start to the state which it is in today so that you can understand the purpose of this project and how it's features can come in handy to you and also answer the question as to why this project isn't being archived even though it's no longer in active development and has already been replaced by an alternative project.

## Introduction

This is my first post on the Lantern OS WIKI.

This WIKI is the knowledge point for all things LanternOS.

:::info
This project is no longer in active development as an alternative project has been created using the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) which is much better than C and that OS has many more features and greater experimental surface. But, this project is being retained and NOT archived since it's written in `C` and is useful for those who want to experiment in `C` and not `Rust`.

This blog post is yet to be completed. It is supposed to marked as draft, but isn't so that whatever has already been written might be found useful.
