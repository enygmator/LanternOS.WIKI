# About LanternOS

LanternOS was created by [Enygmator [Tarun Aditya Thurlapati]](https://github.com/enygmator) as part of a Project in his 1st Year (second semester), B-Tech (Undergrad) - Computer Science & Engineering, Course in PES University.

The goal of the project was to explore how operating systems work and use that knowledge to create an experimental "hobby" OS to gain some experience in low level (systems programming) and at the same time, have fun doing something from scratch, learning along the way.

2. It will target IA-32 (i686 GCC cross-compiler) kernel (32-bit)
3. The OS is usually consisting of a bootloader, a kernel, a shell and a GUI.
